    "We consider performance data from [Glossy](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5779066) collected on [the FlockLab testbed](http://flocklab.ethz.ch/) as experiment environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Glossy](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5779066) is a low-power wireless protocol based on synchronous transmissions and a flooding strategy. One important tuning parameter of Glossy is the number of times $N$ that each node transmit each packet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The literature reports that a larger $N$ yields better reliability; that is, a larger packet reception ratio (PRR). We performed a short experimental study to validate this  observation. \n",

    "- $N=1$\n",
    "- $N=2$\n",

    "\n",
