    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we consider that experiments have been designed, that the  \n",
    "corresponding data has been collected, and we focus on the data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "_TriScale_'s methodology is structured around three time scales:\n",
    "- **Runs** which lead to the computation of performance **metrics**;\n",
    "- **Series** which lead to the computation of **key performance indicators (KPIs)**;\n",
    "- **Sequels** which lead to the computation of **variability scores**.\n",

    "### Runs and Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "In _TriScale_, metrics measure performance dimension during one run. The computation of metrics  \n",
    "is implmented in the `analysis_metric()` function, which takes two compulsory arguments:\n",
    "- the raw data;\n",
    "- the metric definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw data can be passed as a file path (i.e., a string) or as a Pandas DataFrame. \n",
    "- If a string is passed, the function tries to read the file as a csv file (comma separated)  \n",
    "where `x` data is expected in the first column and `y` data in the second column. \n",
    "- If a pandas DataFrame is passed, `data` must contain columns named `x` and `y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metric definition is provided as a dictionary, with only the `measure` key being compulsory.  \n",
    "This key defines \"what is the computation to be performed\" on the data; in other word, what the \"metric\" is.  \n",
    "Currently supported measures are:\n",
    "- Any percentile ($0<P<100$);\n",
    "- `mean`;\n",
    "- `minimum`;\n",
    "- `maximum`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `analysis_metric()` function returns 3 outputs:\n",
    "- the result of the convergence test (not discussed in this notebook);\n",
    "- the value of the metric's measure;\n",
